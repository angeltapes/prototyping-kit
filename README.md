lightweight bootstrap set-up for rapid prototyping

I've included full-sized bootstrap.css and .js files, not minimized versions. 

The index file links to local assets, not CDNs.

'Templates' will contain examples of page types: hero, web page, wizard, email and so on. 

To make it easier to share work, perhaps use a prefix like 'se-button' to show it's our custom style; save these in the custom-style.css file.
